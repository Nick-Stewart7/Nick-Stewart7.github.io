            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>The 15 puzzle solver is a program written in C. When run the application takes 2 parameters being: the puzzle as text, state space search method.
                There are 3 options to pick from. This program will solve using either Depth-First search, Breadth-First search or A-Star depending on the option selected.
                The program works by creating a representation of the board internally as a 2D array and then generating new boards to simulate the movement of the blank piece and expand the state space.
                The program will then choose a board from the generated frontier according to the search method desired and continue the process of expanding the state space and picking according to the search method.
                Once the goal state is generated by the algorithm the program outputs the path of board states to follow to arrive at the solution. In other words the program will output the step by step solution to the given puzzle. 
            </p>
            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <p>How immensely powerful pointers are but also how tricky they are. Almost all operations performed by this algorithm are done using pointers to reference the objects. This was done to avoid creating extra resources in an already memory intensive process.
                This project solidified my understanding of DFS and BFS and exposed me to the new idea of A-Star.
                I also gained my first real world experience with theory of computational complexity and time complexity. 
                Obviously DFS is the most time-inefficient algorithm to pick for this problem. With complex puzzles DFS would take several hours while the A-Star method would be done in a few seconds.
                This very real example of time complexity gave me a new found appreciation for the art of optimization and algorithm building.
